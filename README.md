# API Movies Project

This project is an exercise by Factor√≠a F5. The objective of the exercise was to create an API with all the main methods of CRUD (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE). It was also necessary to create One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relations between tables.

An extra objective was to create a sixth endpoint (apart from getAll, getById, post, update, delete) that would get a movie by its' title.

The project was created using Spring and Maven.
